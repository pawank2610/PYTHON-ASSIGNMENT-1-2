# 🐍 Python Assignments: Calories Tracker & Gradebook System

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains two Python projects created as part of coursework assignments. Both are written in **Jupyter Notebooks** and demonstrate foundational programming skills such as functions, conditionals, loops, user input handling, and file operations.

### 🔹 1. Calories Assignment (`caloriesassignment.ipynb`)
A simple **Daily Calorie Tracker** that helps users log meals and track their total calorie intake throughout the day. The project uses Python’s built-in `datetime` module to record timestamps and demonstrates basic user interaction via console input/output.

### 🔹 2. Gradebook Assignment (`Gradebookassignment.ipynb`)
A **Gradebook Management System** that allows a teacher or user to manage student grades, calculate averages, and display a summary report. It demonstrates the use of functions, lists/dictionaries, and formatted output.
